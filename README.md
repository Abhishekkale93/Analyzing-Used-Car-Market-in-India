#  Used Car Market Analysis - India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

This project aims to analyze the **used car market in India** using Python, leveraging data analytics techniques to uncover insights into pricing trends, popular brands, and key factors that influence resale value.

---

##  Objectives

- Understand the structure of the Indian used car market.
- Clean and preprocess real-world automotive data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
- Derive actionable insights to assist buyers, sellers, or marketplaces.

##  Tools & Libraries

| Tool            | Purpose                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `Python`        | Programming Language           |
| `Pandas`        | Data manipulation              |
| `NumPy`         | Numerical operations           |
| `Matplotlib`    | Basic data visualizations      |
| `Seaborn`       | Advanced statistical plotting  |
| `Jupyter Lab/Notebook` | Interactive data analysis |

---

##  Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Import & Inspection**
   - Load the dataset using pandas.
   - Perform a sanity check on rows, columns, and data types.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Remove irrelevant features.
   - Correct inconsistent formatting.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract numerical values from text (e.g., Mileage, Engine, Power).
   - Convert `Year` to `Car Age`.
   - Drop or transform columns like `Torque` which are difficult to parse.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Univariate Analysis: Distribution of price, fuel type, owner type.
   - Bivariate Analysis: Impact of engine size, mileage, age on price.
   - Heatmaps to examine correlation between numerical variables.

### 5. **Key Visualizations**
   -  Price Distribution
   -  Fuel Type vs Price
   -  Seller Type Impact
   -  Car Age vs Resale Price
   -  Top Brands by Average Price

---

##  Key Insights

- **Car Age** has a significant negative correlation with price.
- **Diesel and Petrol cars** dominate the market; diesel cars tend to be priced higher.
- **Manual transmission** is more common, though automatic cars often command higher prices.
- Some brands, like **Toyota and Honda**, retain their value better.
